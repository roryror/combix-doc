type: minor

**Features**:

* Rename workflow in the workflow editor.

* Dark mode by default:  Many users told us that they prefer dark mode to light mode. Now dark mode is supported.
* Support Fooocus styles, support style preview: Many users like style presets and style preview in Fooocus. In this version, over 150+ styles are added into Text to Image and Image to Image nodes. We provide style preview images for each style. The experience is similar to using Fooocus.
* UI optimization: We have optimized the UI displayed by the nodes to reduce the space occupied by each node.
* Better Editing Experience:
* Copy and paste are supported.
* Link connection: Links can only be connected to valid inputs or outputs
* Recently Used Nodes: You can quickly find the most frequently used nodes in the Recent panel.


**Fix**:
* Image saving problems.
