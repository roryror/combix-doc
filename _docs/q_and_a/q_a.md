## How to use 

Welcome to our Image-to-Image feature!

Simply upload your image, choose your preferred style, and input your desired prompts. Once satisfied, apply 'Denoise' for final refinement.


### Denoise
Compared to generating 'text to Image', you will find that we now have a new parameter: Denoise. 

'Denoise' is a powerful feature that enhances the clarity of images. By reducing noise and artifacts in the image, 'Denoise' makes the image clearer and brings out more details. 

You can control the level of image similarity by adjusting the Denoise parameter to achieve different effects. 


In the following examples, we will keep the other parameters unchanged and only modify the value of denoise.

| Denoise | Results | Intensity |
| :---------:| :---------: | :---------: | 
| 0 | <img src="https://doc.combix.ai/doc_images/i2i 0.jpeg" alt="workflow" width="60%" /> | Same |
| 0.5 | <img src="https://doc.combix.ai/doc_images/i2i 0.5.jpg" alt="workflow" width="60%" /> | Slight |
| 0.75 | <img src="https://doc.combix.ai/doc_images/i2i 0.75.jpeg" alt="workflow" width="60%" /> | Significant |
| 1 | <img src="https://doc.combix.ai/doc_images/i2i 1.jpeg" alt="workflow" width="60%" /> | Transformative |

In short, we adjust the degree of change by altering the denoising strength value. The higher the denoising strength value, the greater the image transformation.
