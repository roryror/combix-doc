**Combix** workflow:
<div align=center><img src="https://doc.combix.ai/doc_images/import_comfyui_1.jpg" alt="workflow" width="90%" /></div>

## Import From ComfyUI

To import ComfyUI workflow, you can click the ```Load ComfyUI``` button in the top left corner of the edit screen, and then choose a ```.json``` file.

**Combix** workflow:
<div align=center><img src="https://doc.combix.ai/doc_images/import_comfyui_2.jpg" alt="load comfyui" width="70%" /></div>

If the file format is valid, the imported workflow will be displayed in the editor.

Combix support most of the original nodes and some of the most commonly used extension nodes in ComfyUi. However, missing nodes sometimes occur, in which case combix will import all supported nodes, remove unsupported nodes, and delete all connections to unsupported nodes
